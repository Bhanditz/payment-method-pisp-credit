        This specification is a Payment Method specification for use by Payment
        Initiation Service Providers (PISPs) with PaymentRequest API
        [[payment-request]]. PISPs are defined as part of the European Payment
        Service Directive 2 (PSD2). With this payment method, merchants can
        more easily accept credit transfers in conjunction with PISPs. The PISP
        are regulated and could be automatically authenticated by the Payer's bank. 
        Thus, the link between PISP and payer'sd bank is secure. Furthermore, 
        PISP have contractual relationships with merchant. Thus, the issue of 
        tamperisation the merchant IBAN (payee IBAN) no longer exists. 
        On the other hand, we do not add a new issue with the IBAN of the payer,
        because this IBAN is by the PISP as a routing code. The real credit transfer 
         will be procesed only after an authentication  of the payer. (by the way, the 
        PDS2 considers that the IBAN of the payer is not a sensitive data).
