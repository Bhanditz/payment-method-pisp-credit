        This specification is a Payment Method specification for use by Payment
        Initiation Service Providers (PISPs) with PaymentRequest API
        [[payment-request]]. PISPs are defined as part of the European Payment
        Service Directive 2 (PSD2). With this payment method, merchants can
        more easily accept credit transfers in conjunction with PISPs.

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This specification is a Payment Method Specification used by the
        PaymentRequest API [[!payment-request]] to support payment by credit
        transfer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs) are defined as part of the
        European Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2). The goal of this payment
        method is to create a simple but secure exchange of data that leverages
        the information that is known by banks under the regulation, and the
        strong authentication required by PSD2.
      </p>
      <p>
        This payment method flow works as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The response data from the payer's payment app includes information
        about the payer's bank and account.
        </li>
        <li>The merchant's PISP receives this information, either directly or
        via the merchant.
        </li>
        <li>The PISP communicates the payment request to the payer's bank,
        which authenticates the user to confirm the payment.
        </li>
        <li>The credit transfer is initiated only after authentication.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This payment method offers several benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Merchants do not release sensitive bank account information,
        reducing the risk of phishing attacks.
        </li>
        <li>The payment method has "pull" characteristics.
        </li>
        <li>The link betewen the PISP and the payer's bank is secure (under
        PSD2) and the payer's bank can authenticate the PISP.
        </li>
        <li>Under PSD2, the payer's IBAN is not considered sensitive data; here
        it used for routing. The actual credit transfer does not occur until
        after the payer's bank has authenticated the payer.
        </li>
      </ul>

              standardized and is more likely known to the payer (whereas the

              This member identifies the network to be used by the originator

              credit transfer network corresponding to the country of the
              payer's bank (e.g., SEPA will be used for Euros).
